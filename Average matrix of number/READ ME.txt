So... I averaged a matrix of numbers of Matt Parker.
With that average and the original picture I could then use the blur to make a edge detect

Original - Blur, will give you highlighted region of change

(this was used from how substance deisgner handles edge detection)
Areas of that have lots of change will become blurred. They will have significantly different values.
Areas of little change will stay roughly the same.

So when you take the orignal and minus off the blur map you are left with areas of high change.

What about areas that become brighter in the blur map, when you subtract off you'll be left with negative numbers? 
For situations like that you can just string it through an absolute function.
